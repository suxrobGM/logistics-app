      Logistics TMS was founded in 2024 with a clear goal: give trucking companies the modern
      software tools they deserve. Too many fleets still rely on spreadsheets, phone calls, and
      disconnected systems to manage their operations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-steel leading-relaxed">
      We set out to build an all-in-one platform that brings dispatching, load tracking, invoicing,
      fleet management, and real-time communication into a single, easy-to-use system. From owner
      operators with a handful of trucks to growing fleets scaling their operations, our platform is
      designed to grow with you.
    </p>
    <p class="text-steel leading-relaxed">
      With dedicated portals for dispatchers, customers, and drivers, plus integrations with ELD
      providers, load boards, and payment processors, Logistics TMS helps every part of your
      operation work together seamlessly.
