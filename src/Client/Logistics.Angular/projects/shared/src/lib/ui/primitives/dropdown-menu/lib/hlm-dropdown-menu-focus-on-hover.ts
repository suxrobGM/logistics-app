/**
 * @internal
 * Moves DOM focus to the hovered menu item. CDK menus only move focus with the keyboard, so on a pointer
 * the highlight would otherwise stay on the last keyboard-focused item (leaving two rows highlighted) and,
 * when a submenu closes, focus would fall to <body>, the menu stack would report no focus, and the whole
 * dropdown would collapse. Following the pointer with focus (Radix/shadcn behaviour) keeps a single
 * highlight and keeps focus inside the menu stack. setActiveMenuItem also syncs the key manager so keyboard
 * navigation continues from the hovered item.
 *
 * Applied as a host directive on every dropdown item type (item, checkbox, radio, sub-trigger).
